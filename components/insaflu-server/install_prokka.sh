# Clones prokka v1.12 and installs the tbl2asn binary shipped in the build
# context.
#
# Upstream originally fetched tbl2asn from the NCBI anonymous ftp endpoint:
#   wget -O tbl2asn.gz ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools/converters/by_program/tbl2asn/linux64.tbl2asn.gz
# That line is commented out here, but the same URL is still live in
# commands/update-tbl2asn, which is on the PATH and runs at runtime, not at
# build time. The endpoint now returns 550 file does not exist, so that
# command is broken.
